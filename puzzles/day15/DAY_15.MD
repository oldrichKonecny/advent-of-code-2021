# :magic_wand: AoC 2021 Day 15 :christmas_tree:

[task](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15)

Day 15 was kinda hard, at least for me. It took me a lot of time to get it right. Quiet simple algorithm, 
but I had a lot of bugs, mostly with forgotten hardcoded constants. 
Also this s day should be run in release mode, otherwise the second part takes a lot of time to finish.

[task](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)

For day 5 I decided to use peg for parsing and thiserror. Not really needed, 
but I thought it might be good practise for future puzzles where I expect parsing 
will be more difficult. 

Regarding today's task, the hardest thing for me was computing all points on diagonal lines.
After that, everything was pretty straightforward. 

Also, I'm still not pleased with the elegancy and performance of my solutions and should work on that...
